My choice of living in city or suburban 
Now many people have different opinions about whether city life is better than suburban life. As for me, I prefer city life.
My major reason is that the overall living standards in city are much better than that in the suburb. The high living standards make me feel myself living in the modern life. More specifically, there are more ways and places of entertainment in city. We can go to KTV, go shopping at the department store, see a movie, etc. But we can seldom see these in suburban, which make it more joyful to live in city. When it comes to traffic, it's obviously that cities have transport facilities. Through the convenient transportation, you can go wherever you want to go. What's more, the medical and health conditions in city are perfect, too. The consummation system of medical care insurance has protected so many people's health. Thanks to it, we can live more securely.
All in all, from my point of view, it's significantly better to live in cities than in the suburb.
