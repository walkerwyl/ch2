China's grand sci-fi is going global

China's grand sci-fi is going global in the future, when the Sun runs out of fuel and begins to expand, Earthings dig thousands of mountain-sized rockets into their planet's surface and use them to propel their home away from certain destruction.

This is the plot of "The Wandering Earth", a Chinese film adapted from a short story of the same name by Liu Cixin, China's leading writer of science fiction. After taking over $700m in cinemas, mostly in China, it launched on Netfix in May, making ti the first Chinese sci-fi movie to go global.

As China's economy has grown over the past 30 years, its sci-fi writers' vision has expanded, too. Their stories tend to focus on Earth itself-eschewing galaxies far far away and long ago - while being conceived on a stupendous scale. One recurring wideangle shot in "The Wandering Earth", for example,, shows the planet gliding through space on a pincushion of blue flame, its atmosphere trailing off into a vacuum.

Chinese sci-fi took its first step towards the global stage in 2014 with the English publication of "The Three-Body Problem", the first book in a trilogy by Mr Liu. A crop of younger writers are now emerging. The writers of Chinese science fiction anticipated their genre's rising profile. In 2010 Fei Dao, another author, described its devotees as a "lonely hidden army". Chinese sci-fi, he said, might "unexpectedly rush out and change heaven and Earth". That has not quite happended yet. But in the future, anything is possible.
